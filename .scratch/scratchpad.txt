You configure the runpod to inject the env var at launch time. Ah

In environment variables section:
Key:    RUNPOD_ID
Value:  $RUNPOD_POD_ID     (Dynamically updated)

.env file required for the others, it's simpler. But because the routes rely on
the generated pod, runpid_id must be passed at pod build time

I wonder if there are more interesting ways to monetize this whole thing...
I mean, I can basically do everything now.. I shouldn't need anyone until I'm
making a ton of money somehow, and by then I should be hiring people only to 
take over what I've built so I can chill

Looks like I fixed the gpu issue! Having control over the image is an absolutel 
hard requirement going forward

Test make sure dyamic variable works, then gym time

After the gym I'm sure there will be lots of kinks to work out, but it will be nice to
see if we can get 4090 runs in by tonight with personal custom environment
