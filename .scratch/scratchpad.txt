You configure the runpod to inject the env var at launch time. Ah

In environment variables section:
Key:    RUNPOD_ID
Value:  $RUNPOD_POD_ID     (Dynamically updated)

.env file required for the others, it's simpler. But because the routes rely on
the generated pod, runpid_id must be passed at pod build time
