The right pragmatic choice, prioritizing clean code architecture and simplicity over
optimizing a performance metric that simply doesn't matter for your use case.
    - scales suitably for your architecture model

I need to think from a more pragmatic perspective. Look for simplest solutions possible only!



Re-synthesize a specific row using the LLM

The button

Add an action button next to each row in the Dash table that the user clicks


So, the new endpoint returns a success message to Callback 1 (handle_batch_resynthesis), 
and Callback 1 (handle_batch_resynthesis) increments the trigger, 
which starts Callback 2 (refresh ie pull from db) to refresh the table.



Oh what the fuck it's magic

The column structure has already been defined by the first callbakc and won't change
during the session. 

It just updates the data property

oh conflicting , duplicate columns and its trying to decide which one to keep, got it

Actively refining the data using your tool

Upload -> Action -> Download

"Instead of just showing "here is your product type," the tool will soon show "this product 
type is oversaturated in Q4 market." This immediately increases the value proposition for 
an enterprise customer."

Not entirely sure what to do about this part

Wow

You need to derive the 
original column order 
from the result of the API call, but
maintain the sequence found in the original csv file...

The data is there, but it's pretty bad


Product description lacks price and currency information.


Fix bug llm is reading all fields from the pydantic field
Nevermind its iin the prompt... so it's working super well...

This thing is actually working... Like... it's almost seemingly helpful

It just needs polishing
